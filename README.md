# ScRNA-seq mouse heart clustering - Group Project 

## About the project
![COMPgpWorkflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125702969/227393937-d72af62e-aec8-4467-913a-bcf7bc7c1e8c.png)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is used for global gene expression analysis at a single cell resolution and to improve research on cell-type heterogeneity within the same tissue type. An understanding of cell heterogeneity is significant for developing targeted drugs and for the creation of new therapeutic approaches. It can also allow for a deeper understanding of the tissues and systems that use these cells. To identify the cells present, and map them to clusters, the pipeline scRNA-Seq Variation in Mouse Heart was created. The tool was created to retrieve fastq files from NCBI and map the reads pulled to a heart model created by CellRanger. The CellRanger output, combined with analysis by Seurat, can then be used to make plots and tables of significant clusters and differentially expressed features.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To add to the original scRNA-Seq Variation in Mouse Heart tool, a new pipeline will be added after the clustering stage of pipeline two that will create a list of highly expressed MYBPHL positive cells, identify a list of highly expressed genes from these cells, then re-cluster the list of highly expressed genes. Details on this can be seen in the flowchart below, and in the design document under the wiki tab.

## Workflow 

### Step one: Run pipeline one

This step pulls mouse heart scRNA-seq data from NCBI, organizes the FastQ files into a folder called mouse_heart_SRA_data, and stores genomic data into a folder called mouse_genome. A final output stores barcodes, features, and matrix files into a folder called cellranger_output. 

Input files: 
- twelve SRA files, each associated with different regions of the heart
  - 3 AVN: Atrioventricular node/His bundle 
  - 3 LPF: Left purkinje fiber 
  - 3 RPF: Right purkinje fiber 
  - 3 SAN: Sinoatrial node 

Output files: 

- Three folders with mouse heart genomic data 

### Step two: Run pipeline two

This step pulls mouse heart GEO data from NCBI, and stores the data into a folder called mouse_heart_GEO_data. The new information is then reformatted into Seurat readable form, and outputs are stored in seurat_output. This is where Clustering.R is run to pass the reformatted data through Seurat. 

Input files: 
- four folders from each region of the heart, each containing barcode, feature, and matrix information 

Output files: 
- seurat_output folder contianing matrices of cell and gene prevelance based on different heart zones, and three t-SNE plots mapping cells to the three zones of the heart. 

### Step three: Run pipeline three 
-- work in progress 

## Example Code 
1. Clone the repository  
```
https://github.com/anisamn/CompGroupProject-
```
2. If you want to use to provided example code, skip to step three. Or, run piprline_2.py
```
nohup python pipeline_2.py > pipeline2_run.out
```
2. Run pipeline three to see clusters of specified cells 
```
python pipeline_3.py 
```

## Languages and Packages Required 

### Installation for CellRanger
CellRanger: analysis tool that processes single cell data, generates barcode matrices, and clustering

```

### Installation for Seurat

Seurat: An R package that performs QC and analysis of scRNA-seq data

Seurat: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/install.html

```
remotes::install_github("satijalab/seurat", "seurat5", quiet = TRUE)
```

### Package Installation for R: 

```
library(Seurat) 
library(patchwork) 
library(dplyr) 
```

### Package Installation for Python: 

```
import os
import retrieveDataSRA 
import reformatDataSRA
import mapReads 
import retrieveDataGEO
import reformatDataGEO
import clusteringAnalysis

```

## Flags for input files: 

### fastqDump: downloads fastq files from all input samples 

- fastq-dump: calls the required program 

- I: allows for the sequences to get appended to ID .1 and ID .2 

- --split-files: splits the fastq files into two files  

### Clustering cells using Seurat
Commands using Seurat can be found in reformatDataGEO.py where the GEO barcodes, genes and matrix files are converted to Seurat readable form. And, Clustering.R where a Seurat object for each zone of the heart is created.
